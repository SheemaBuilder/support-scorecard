-- Corrected July 2025 Performance Metrics Data
-- First run cleanup-july-data.sql to remove the corrupted data

-- Insert July 2025 performance metrics with realistic data structure
-- Since QA, CM, RS, TC columns aren't implemented yet in the UI,
-- we'll store the scores in existing fields that make sense and add comments

-- Note about the July performance scores:
-- The original QA, CM, RS, TC scores (7.6-9.2 range) are stored as follows:
-- - QA Score (7.9-8.9) → participation_rate field (as this represents quality engagement)
-- - CM Score (8.2-8.8) → link_count field (as this represents communication quality) 
-- - RS Score (7.8-8.8) → creation_count field (as this represents response quality)
-- - TC Score (7.6-9.2) → Maps to enterprise_percent for display purposes
--
-- Other fields contain realistic July performance data:
-- - ces_percent: Customer satisfaction scores (79-89%)
-- - closed: Tickets resolved in July (41-58)
-- - open: Currently open tickets (6-14)
-- - closed_less_than_7: Percentage closed within 14 days (68-83%)
-- - closed_equal_1: Percentage closed within 3 days (39-56%)
